## **Installation and Running**

1. Download and extract the files.

2. Run the code Problem_1.py using the following command in your terminal
    ***python3 Problem_1.py***
   It contains the code for all the three subquestions.
Three pop up windows:
**window 1**: centroid plotted on an arbitrarily selected frame from the video stream by filtering the image.
**window 2**: Superpositioned Centroids of the ball in all the frames in which it was detected on the sample frame.
**window 3**: Trajectory estimate of the path followed by the red ball in the video
**The terminal displays the following**:
 - the number of frames in which the code was able to detect the red ball.
 - Equation of the parabolic trajectory.
 - Roots of the trajectory eq for the given boundary condition.
 - x-coordinate of the landing spot.

3. A detailed report of the entire project is given in ***report.pdf***
